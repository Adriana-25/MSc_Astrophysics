\end{center}
This thesis work examines the variability properties of a sample of stars included in the PLATO Input Catalogue, which has been selected through a cross-match operation with the variable sources in the Gaia Data Release 3.
Particularly, the study focuses on the photometric, astrometric and spectroscopic data analysis of 11 specific classes of variable objects, and on the relevance of these sources for the PLATO space mission.\\
Finally, a comparison with several catalogues of variable objects from the literature is undertaken.
